Going beyond Myers and Doyle (Myers and Doyle 1983) and building on Gunderson (1980), Gunderson and Dygert (1988) use reproductive effort as such a trait:

$$M = 0.03+ 1.68GSI$$

where GSI is the gonadal-somatic-index.


## Age-dependent natural mortality

$$M(t) = \frac{K}{1-e^{-K(t-t_0)}}$$

```{r}

-log(0.05/18)


```
